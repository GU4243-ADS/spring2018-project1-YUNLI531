### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

**Term: Spring 2018**

+ **Project title: SPOOKY Data Analysis -- whether are they appropriate for children to read?**
+ **This project is conducted by Yun, Li**
+ **Project summary:**

    This project is an analysis of the horror fiction. The initial purpose was to establish a book classification system similar to the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) film rating system. We analyzed texts from Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley, and HP Lovecraft with the goal to find out whether they are appropriate for children to read. In this project, we did word frequency analysis, sentiment analysis and topic modeling analysis. In word frequency part, we focused on the word frequency of each author's work and the correlation between them.
    
    + In sentiment analysis part, we compared the results from NRC lexicon and Bing lexicon. We also did a further step about negativity analysis and violent word analysis.
    
    + In topic modeling part, we chose 6 topics and tried to find the difference in probabilities between the topics.  

    unfortunately, I didn't find a way to set up a standard to justify whether there is too much violent mood in their works. I would like to explore more in this area and hope in the future, we will have a baseline, for example, when these violent terms make up about 20% or more of the entire article, children need to read such books under the guidance of their parents.
